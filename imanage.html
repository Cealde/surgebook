                It is easy for every player to feel lost with the amount of things that they have to do to get an edge on an enemy, while gathering resources in the grace period,
            </p>
            <p>
                That's why item management is important, instead of just getting whatever comes to mind at the present moment, look at every item that will get you an advanatage and try to evolve strategies around that specfic item and focus and getting that item
            </p>
            <p>
                Split up the 30 minutes that you get to gather items to specfic stages, and split them among your teammates, consider the first 10 minutes to gather the armor and weapons, after the 10 minutes 1 player of your team can still gather the diamond and ancient debris to get better gear, while you and the other teammates can focus on other tasks because only 1 player is needed to provide the gear and weaponry for the rest of the entire team after the first 10 minutes of item gathering
            </p>
            <p>
                Example: after 10 minutes when every player has gotten half-diamond armor and full diamond tools, 1 player can stay in the cave mining for more diamonds and ancient debris and provide netherite ingots for the rest of the teammates while another player can focus on the other items such as a wind charge or an upgrade smithing template, this splitting of tasks ensures that maximum item management is reached.
