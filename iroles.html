            <p>
                There are an intended amount of 4 players in each team, when every player does the same task, efficiency is hindered, this part will tell you about how important role management is-
            </p>
            <p>
                when all players of a team starts mining, sometimes resources get stolen and things like building a better defense is ignored on the basis of just getting stronger gear, and after the timer ends, all the players are left with good gear but a bad defense and gets destroyed immediatly, to prevent this assigning roles to each teammate is a great tactic: as 1 player can get a spelunker role where their role is to gather the resources to get better gear, while another player can get the defender role where their job is to build a strong defense and middle platform connection, many roles like this can be assigned to different players
            </p>
            <p>
                and during the final minutes of the grace period, all the items gathered by each role is shared for an even fight, even roles can be assigned after the grace period, as someone can stay back at their base to protect their jigsaw, while 2 players can rush to gain mid-control while 1 player can become a rat in a cave trying to build tunnels to the enemy base
