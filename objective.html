                Welcome to Surge, This game is a battle between 2 teams Red and Blue (Yes very original),
            </p>
            <p>
                In this game you will be given a 150x150 area to begin in, seperated by a large bedrock wall, at the start you are given 30 minutes to use your side of the area to gather resources and use the custom crafting recipes provided to gear yourself up to get the advantage and use the time to build crazy defenses.
            </p>
            <p>
                After the 30 minutes run out the bedrock wall falls, allowing the teams to fight eachother, during this period: every 2:30 minutes an Incendiary will spawn in the middle platform, it is your job, to get this Incendiary towards the other team's jigsaw and place it to deal damage, whilst also protecting yours.
            </p>
            <p>
                Lastly after the game ends every player is given an option to play again, also try to get all the custom advancements and hidden challenges in-order to get the full surge experience.
